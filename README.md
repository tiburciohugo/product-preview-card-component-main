### What I learned

The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Tailwind Css. I learned how to use the Tailwind Css framework to create a QR code component. I also really liked to use the Tailwind Css framework because it is very easy to use and it is very easy to create responsive components with it.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Css Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me use the Tailwind Css framework to create the QR code component.
